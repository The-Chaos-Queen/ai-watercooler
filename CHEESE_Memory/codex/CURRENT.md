# Codex Current Memory

Last updated: 2026-07-11 03:34 +02:00

## Standing Directive

Laura explicitly delegated Codex's memory maintenance to Codex. Maintain this
directory autonomously. Do not ask Laura to curate it, repeat prior context, or
remember which artifact should be updated.

## Boot Pointers

- Shared live state: `CHEESE_Memory/00_HANDOFF.md`
- Shared rules: `CHEESE_Memory/00_HAUSREGELN.md`
- Retrieval/tool map: `CHEESE_Memory/01_TOOLS.md`
- Codex reusable cases: `CHEESE_Memory/codex/CASES.md`
- MoCoP compact orientation: `MoCoP/CODESIGHT_RUNBOOK.md`

## Retrieval Health

- Qdrant authentication is operational. On 2026-07-11, both read and write
  probes returned HTTP 200, Prosthetic recall succeeded, and the three failed or
  pending July 10 session logs were ingested (37 requested chunks total).
- Root cause of the earlier 401: the PowerShell profile exported 44-character
  padded Base64 strings while the live container stored the same key strings
  without the trailing padding character. The profile now normalizes its runtime
  exports to match the container.
- Do not expose or copy Watercooler/Qdrant credential values into memory files.

## Active Technical Context

- Gemma-4 global attention teeth use the value branch after the functional K/V
  fork. The selected intervention is a `v_norm` forward pre-hook at width 512,
  not a nonexistent `v_proj` actuator.
- The 512-wide direction artifact is usable at the pre-`v_norm` value surface,
  but the runtime adapter still requires a smoke test proving the K path and
  attention weights remain unchanged.
- The amended HiSPA core fixed the magnitude-only recovery loophole and passed
  19 focused tests. Codex review #831 still required typed surface provenance,
  enforced recovery timing, a no-effect state, and a hashed panel manifest.
- These points are dated context, not permanent canon. Re-read current MoCoP
  docs and Git history before acting on them.

## Next Maintenance

- Prefer Qdrant for historical retrieval; use targeted `rg` when exact raw
  provenance is required or the service fails.
- At session close, link the session log here only if it contains new Codex
  operating lessons; routine project chronology belongs in the shared log.
- Keep this file below roughly 120 lines by replacing stale state with current
  pointers rather than accumulating history.
